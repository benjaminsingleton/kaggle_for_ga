# Predict whether a Stack Overflow question will be closed
Kaggle Competition for General Assembly class

Millions of programmers use Stack Overflow to get high-quality answers to their programming questions every day. They take quality very seriously, and have evolved an effective culture of moderation to safeguard it.

Currently about 6% of all new questions end up "closed". Questions can be closed as off-topic, not constructive, not a real question, or too localized. Your goal is to build a classifier that predicts whether or not a question will be closed given the question as submitted. Additional data about the user at question creation time is also available.

This is a Kaggle In-Class competition for the students of General Assembly's DAT-NYC-28 course in Washington, DC, and is based on a previous Kaggle competition.
